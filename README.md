# Sample-Code
This repository contains sample code mostly for the Raspberry Pi and Raspbian, created by meigrafd and others. The idea for this repository was posted on the german [Raspberry Pi forum](http://www.forum-raspberrypi.de/Thread-andere-samplecoderepository).

**Please note that this repository is fairly new (and unordered). Feel free to clean up the structure or add useful information to the wiki. Thanks!*
